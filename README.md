# Geologistics-Backend-Showcase
# GeoLogistics Backend Project 

This project is a **Full-Stack Web GIS** application developed as part of the **GMT-458** course requirements. 

Due to academic integrity and privacy policies, the source code is maintained in a **Private** repository. However, this repository serves as a showcase to demonstrate the system architecture, technical stack, and implemented capabilities.

##  Tech Stack
* **Node.js & Express:** Scalable RESTful API architecture.
* **PostgreSQL & PostGIS:** Advanced spatial data management and querying.
* **MongoDB (NoSQL):** Storage for heterogeneous package details (Hybrid Database approach).
* **JWT Auth:** Secure authentication and role-based authorization (Currently in development).

##  Key Features
*  **CRUD Operations:** Full lifecycle management (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for spatial delivery points.
*  **Spatial Queries:** Executing geospatial queries using PostGIS capabilities.
*  **Hybrid Architecture:** Synchronized data consistency between Relational (SQL) and NoSQL databases.
